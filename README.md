# AutoQuiz AI

**Core Idea:**  
A Chrome extension that uses AI (e.g., a large language model) to automatically create a short quiz based on the web page the user is reading. This helps readers self-test their understanding of the material.

### How it Works

1. **Content Extraction:** When a user visits a page and clicks the extension icon, the extension scrapes or extracts the main text from the page (e.g., ignoring ads and other clutter).
2. **AI Prompting:** The extracted text is sent to an AI model that generates a concise set of questions—multiple-choice, short answer, or true/false—to assess comprehension.
3. **Quiz Presentation:** The extension displays the quiz in a popup or side panel. Users can answer immediately or save the quiz to take later.
4. **Feedback & Explanation:** After the user submits answers, the AI can provide not only the correct response but also a brief explanation or relevant references (optional, if you integrate a summary or LLM-based explanation).
5. **Performance Tracking:** The extension can store the user’s performance history, allowing them to see progress over time or revisit material they struggled with.

## Potential Target Audiences

1. **Students & Lifelong Learners:**

   - Anyone studying online material (textbooks, articles, research papers) who wants a quick way to review key points.
   - Ideal for self-directed learners using online resources like Wikipedia or academic journals.

2. **Educators & Trainers:**

   - Teachers or trainers who want to quickly generate quiz questions from reading assignments.
   - Could be used to speed up quiz creation or homework design.

3. **Professional Development & Corporate Training:**
   - Employees taking online compliance courses, tutorials, or continuing education modules could use the extension to create quick comprehension tests.
   - Managers or team leads could recommend the extension to employees to verify understanding of important documents or articles.

## Killer Features to Include

1. **Smart Question Types:**

   - **Multiple-Choice:** Easiest for users to answer quickly.
   - **Short Answer/Fill-in-the-Blank:** Encourages deeper recall.
   - **True/False or Yes/No:** Perfect for a quick check.

2. **Adjustable Difficulty & Scope:**

   - Let users choose how many questions they want (e.g., a quick 3-question check or a more in-depth 10-question test).
   - Add a “Difficulty” slider that influences how in-depth the questions are.

3. **Contextual Explanations:**

   - Use AI to generate a short explanation or relevant snippet from the text when a user answers incorrectly, helping them learn from mistakes.

4. **Progress Tracking & Analytics:**

   - Maintain a local or cloud-based dashboard that shows how many quizzes the user has taken, their average score, areas of strength/weakness, etc.

5. **Integration Options (Long-Term):**
   - **Education Platforms:** Integrate with Google Classroom, Canvas, or Moodle so teachers can auto-generate quizzes for students.
   - **Study Apps:** Export quizzes to apps like Anki for spaced repetition.

## Monetization Strategies

1. **Freemium Model**

   - **Free Tier:** Limited number of quizzes per month and basic quiz types.
   - **Premium Tier (Subscription):**
     - Unlimited quizzes.
     - Advanced question types (scenario-based, case-study questions, etc.).
     - Rich analytics (progress over time, topic difficulty).
     - Priority access to new features and dedicated support.

2. **Pay-Per-Use or Token System**

   - Sell “quiz credits” or tokens for advanced AI-generated quizzes.
   - Ideal for students or teachers who need occasional but higher-volume usage in bursts (e.g., before exams).

3. **Team/Enterprise Plans**

   - Offer custom or volume pricing for schools, tutoring companies, or businesses that want to integrate the quizzes into training materials.
   - Corporate features could include admin dashboards, user management, and aggregated analytics.

4. **Sponsored or Affiliate Content (Optional)**
   - If quizzes reference specific textbooks or learning materials, you could partner with publishers or educational platforms for referral links.
   - This is trickier to balance with user experience, so proceed with caution.

## Technical Considerations

1. **AI Model Usage:**

   - Using a cloud-based Large Language Model (like OpenAI, Cohere, or Anthropic) via their APIs is the fastest route.
   - Be mindful of usage costs and keep track of tokens/requests per user to balance performance and expenses.

2. **Privacy & Data Handling:**

   - Only send essential text to the AI API (and not user personal info).
   - Decide whether you’re storing user quiz data locally in Chrome storage or on your own server.
   - Communicate a clear privacy policy to reassure users.

3. **Extension Performance:**

   - Optimize content extraction to avoid lag or UI slowdowns.
   - If the page is very long, consider summarizing or chunking text before sending it to the AI model.

4. **UI/UX Design:**
   - Keep the quiz interface simple.
   - Provide a clear, minimal overlay or popup with easy navigation.
   - Make it mobile-friendly if the extension is used on Chrome for Android (though extension support on mobile is limited).

## Steps to Validate the Idea

1. **Landing Page & Email Capture:**

   - Build a simple website outlining the concept.
   - Invite people to join a waitlist or beta test the extension.
   - Gauge interest and get early feedback.

2. **Minimal Viable Product (MVP):**

   - Create a basic version that extracts text and generates a few multiple-choice questions.
   - Test with a handful of users (students, teachers, self-learners).
   - Iterate based on feedback.

3. **Pricing Experiment:**
   - A/B test different pricing tiers or subscription plans to see what your target audience is willing to pay.
   - Offer special deals or educational discounts to drive early adoption.

## Final Thoughts

An AI-powered quiz generator extension taps into a clear need: helping people actively engage with and retain information from what they read online. By offering immediate, interactive comprehension checks, you can differentiate your product from generic reading tools. Pair that with a well-designed freemium model or subscription plan, and you could create a recurring revenue stream while also providing genuine value to learners.
