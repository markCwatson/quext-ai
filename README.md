# Quext AI

![alt-text][1]

**Idea:**  
A Chrome extension that uses AI to automatically create a short quiz based on the web page the user is reading. This helps readers self-test their understanding of the material.

### Features

1. **Content Extraction:** When a user visits a page and clicks the extension icon, the extension scrapes or extracts the main text from the page (e.g., ignoring ads and other clutter).
2. **AI Prompting:** The extracted text is sent to an AI model that generates a concise set of questions—multiple-choice, short answer, or true/false—to assess comprehension.
3. **Quiz Presentation:** The extension displays the quiz in a popup or side panel.
4. **Feedback:** After the user submits answers, the user receives immediate feedback and the final score is presented when all questions are done.
5. **Audio Playback:** User can listen to the question using text-to-speak technology.
